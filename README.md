# tor-list-frontend

This is a Gatsby front end web app. It is the user interface for interacting with the [tor-list-api](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/tor-list-frontend) REST API, which allows people to read and write to the OrbitDB that syndicates the Tor List. This front end app was forked from the [bch-wallet-starter](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-wallet-starter) Gatsby Starter.

The live version of this site can be viewed at [torlist.cash](https://torlist.cash).
